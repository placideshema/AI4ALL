Project Name: Sign Language Detector

Research Question: How do differences in regional dialects of American Sign Language (ASL) affect the accuracy of sign language recognition systems, 
and how can models be improved to account for these variations?

Project Description: Our Solution for ASL Detector would be able to consider different variables and we can feed our datasets to test how the age, and sign
accents count for the reliabilities of our system.
